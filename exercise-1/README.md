# Exercise-1

As described in the [git-basics
chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin
by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

Then, in the space below, put your favorite quote in a block quote,
and provide a link to a website that provides additional information
about the quote. When you push your changes back up to GitHub, you
will see the rendered markdown file.

> "I don't have a favorite quote."
